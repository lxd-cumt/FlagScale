# Namespace package configuration
# This allows megatron.core and megatron.plugin to be imported from the installed
# megatron-core package, while other modules (training, rl, post_training, legacy)
# are imported from this source directory.

# Make this a namespace package to allow imports from multiple locations

# The installed megatron-core package will have megatron.core and megatron.plugin
# They will be automatically available through the namespace package mechanism
# No need to explicitly import them here
